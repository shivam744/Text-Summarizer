# Text-Summarizer
As the name suggest it summarizes text. It can also be referred as Summarytool. It uses java program to firstly take a document from user and then it splits the paragraphs then its lines and give each line a line id and para. id and then those lines are stored in a arraylist with an attribute called score with initial value zero. Then the words in the lines are pulled apart and stored in a dictionary with count associated them while doing so the stop words like is, am, are etc are striped away and then we calculate term frequency of every word by dividing the no of occurrences of word in line divided by the no of occurrences in the whole document. Then that factor is saved with that word for each line and every word this factor is called Term-frequency. Then we calculate TFIDF(term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency) in which we divide the tf with the no of occurrences of the word has on other documents chosen on random . Then that tfidf is calculated for every word of each line and added and stored in the score of each line and then we sort the score of every line and display the topmost 15-20 lines that represent the summary of the Document in the order they were on the original document.
